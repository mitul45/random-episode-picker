üì∫ Too lazy to decide what to watch? Just double click an icon and enjoy. üç∏

It's a small utility to watch a random episode of your favorite TV Show. Just run `script.js` with show's home directory as an argument. [View sample](https://github.com/mitul45/random-episode-picker/blob/master/seinfeld.command).

Directory structure:
```
|-- TV Show (Home)
    |-- Season 1
        |-- *.mkv, *.avi *.mp4, *.webm, *.vob
    |-- Season 2
    ...
```

Now sit back and enjoy the show! üíÉ

PS: I remember reading this somewhere: _"If you are getting bored, just click **one** item on your desktop. If that doesn't help, shutdown and go out."_
